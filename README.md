#### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/j-zBOVl05VQ
#### Description:
Welcome to the Sims 2 Aspiration Project! This project aims to enhance your Sims 2 gameplay by counting traits and interests of Sims, and assigning appropriate aspirations based on the results.

## Overview
In The Sims 2, aspirations play a crucial role in determining a Sim's wants and fears. This project aims to make the process of assigning aspirations to Sims more dynamic and realistic by considering their traits and interests, which are derived from the Sim's personality, age, and other factors.

## Features
- Counts traits and interests of Sims
- Assigns appropriate aspirations based on traits and interests
- Has maximum 10 values for traits and interests (like in the game)
- Chooses randomly between two highest score aspirations if it happens to be so
- Gives notification if all of your values are zeros

## Challenge
I chose JavaScript to make calculations of traits and interests and was able to realize general ideas I had. I used HTML and CSS to make it pretty as I feel like i dont have enough design freedom with Bootstrap.

I had to think thoroughly about making these calculations logical but it was not easy to implement all the checks and value conversions. Every aspiration has different counting and there are checks for different situations: if all values are zeros, random aspiration if sum values are equel. I made popups for every scenario with description and additional information.

## Future updates
My plan is to make more complicated system adding zodiac signs, hobbies and imlementing sims 3 traits smart choosing for sims 2.
Also I want to divide 6 main aspirations into sub-aspirations that helps to narrow the choice of life time wishes and bring variety to sims' personalities just like in real life.

I hope you will enjoy the enhanced gameplay experience with Sims 2 AC.
